# TopicModeling-NINR

1. Who is the decision-maker? **NINR administrators**

2. What is the decision being improved? **Which research grant applications align with NINR's historically funded research areas and how well do they align? Which grants do not align with NINR's historically funded research areas? Of these two groups, which topics are assigned to each group and which grants are assigned to each topic?**

3. What is the value of an improved decision? **Less time binning grant applications, more accurate and nuanced clasifications of grants, more precise alignment of research portfolios and NINR's Strategic Plan with applicant interests**


**Question 2**
1. To answer question 2, we will first define NINR's historically funded research areas. 
2. We will select NLP algorithms to extract topics from research grants. 
3. We will select performance metrics to assess the topic groupings.
4. We will use the NLP algorithms to extract topics from research grants and use the performance metrics to evaluate the topic groupings.
5. We will create visualizations of the topic groupings.
