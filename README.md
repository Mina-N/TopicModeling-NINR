# TopicModeling-NINR

Overview
This repository contains implementations of the algorithm Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Python and R. It builds off the work of (1) Alaz Sengul, a 2019 Software Engineering Intern within the Office of Program Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation at the National Institutes of Health and (2) Nathan Moore, a Data Scientist at the Office of the Director.

Research Questions
1. Who is the decision-maker? **NINR leadership, policy analysts, communications, and other staff**

2. What is the decision being improved? **Which research grant applications align with NINR's historically funded research areas and how well do they align? Which grants do not align with NINR's historically funded research areas? Of these two groups, which topics are associated with each group and which grants are grouped with each topic?**

3. What is the value of an improved decision? **Affirmation of the current "hands on" approach for program officer assignments, less time binning grant applications into research categories, more accurate and nuanced clasifications of grants, more precise alignment of NINR's research portfolios and Strategic Plan with applicant interests**
